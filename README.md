- **[Love to make things work](#love-to-make-things-work)** - What can be more joyful than seeing one of our little creations are working and bringing smiles to faces or may be helping to solve a problem? That's how I would define my little experiments.

- **[Passionate Developer](#passionate-developer)** - The consistent & passionate driving force of learning more and more, keeps me going.

- **[Problem Solver](#problem-solver)** - Finding unique ways to solve a problem effectively and never getting afraid of ones, is something I'm enjoy the most.

- **[An Explorer](#an-explorer)** - Always throwing myself into different domains of technology, different paradigms of programming and living in a challenging environment always made me cherish the moment of finally overcoming it.

- **[An Aspiring System Designer](#an-aspiring-system-designer)** - One of the key things that I want to achieve is to be capable enough of delivering greats end to end solutions that is efficient & powerful. With my every experiment, I try to design and deliver better a better system as a whole, while learning the key concepts of it.

- **[Clean Code Enthusiast](#clean-code-enthusiast)** - This is something that I must admit. Writing human readable code and making the code work as it's documentation is something I cherish of doing.

- **[Embracing Failures](#embracing-failures)** - Finally, I love to fail. I love to talk about my failures. Because, without them, I won't be this version of me.

## Love to make things work
Yes I do love to make things works, because you know, when you put so many efforts into something and maybe countless nights of insomnia, and then finally you get that into working. What else can be so soothing?

<br>

## Passionate Developer
I find immense joy to deploy and deliver things. I do realise that,
> Consistency & Patience is the key factor over here.

I remember spending long hours at competitive programming and overflowing diaries with random calculations and patterns, trying to figure out a solution for it. I knew I wasn't good at it initially, But I was curious to learn more each time I attempted it. Only to gain more and more exposure to the domain of things that are yet to be known by me.

<br>

## Problem Solver
> From coding challenges to real life issues
> From abstracted out models to hands on urgent fixes

I lived with this rush, from time to time & each time I learn something more out of it. There has been times when I even had to start again from ground zero, only to learn to design it more tactfully.

This brings me to next point in this which is,

<br>

## An Explorer
While finding solutions for a problem, I often encounter numerous unknown things and that opens up a different world of many technologies.

At this point, I have worked with

| Programming Languages | Web FrameWorks | Web Technologies        | JavaScript FrameWorks | Databases | CrossPlatform Development | Design Systems      |
| ------                | ------         | ------                  | ------                | ------    | ------                    | ------              |
| Python                | Django         | HTML                    | React                 | PostgreSQL| Flutter + Firebase        | Bootstrap           |
| Java                  | Spring-Boot    | SCSS/CSS                | Vue                   | Firebase  | PWAs                      | Material Design     |
| C                     |                | JavaScript / TypeScript | Nuxt.js               | H2        |                           | Figma (Prototyping) |


While switching between technologies, the interesting fact that I learned is that,

> They often share similar concepts, but the way they do that, may differ.

Hence, it's a good idea to learn the concepts and understand the system as a whole, rather than getting coupled to a very language specific stuffs.
**Being Flexible often Comes Handy**

At some point in time, I also took sometime to learn about **Penetration Testing** which allows me to have a mindset where I care about the security and efficiency.

## An Aspiring System Designer
Alright, so each time I create something, I increase the difficulty a bit, in order to put me always out of my comfort zone.

- Previously, I had no idea about how web works and with a hope to learn that, I ended up developing **[A Covid 19 Tracker with realtime scanning](https://covid19response.live)**.
    - Since it wasn't fast enough and that taught me about caching and laziness in programming
    - After a few refactors, I made it performant.

- Moving Forward, I ended up creating a random anonymous chatting area. It's called  **[The Whisper](https://whisper.nubes.live)**.
    - Learning about FCM and Firebase was the main scope of it and with previous learnings are in place, this is also quite performant.

- **[Self Reviewer](https://self.reviewer.nubes.live)**: An AI powered Blogging PWA was another task that put me back to the table with pen and paper.
    - Building a fully managed solution for a blogging platform and integrating the previous learnings into it was one of the core vitals of it too.


### The thing that I feel a bit nice about the Above mentioned stuffs is, they are built using PURE VANILLA JavaScript.

Later, I learned about the client side javascript frameworks and currently working on
- Migrating the Blogging Platform into a Client Side Routing one.
- Building out a new kind of Social media Platform

Hope to be a System Designer someday.

<br>

## Clean Code Enthusiast
While building out that many stuffs, one thing that was very clear to me was this clean coding practise helps in maintaining the codebase very easily. This made my life so easy to extend the features without much of a hassle and even completely rewrite it again into some other language seamlessly.

The fact that my code works as its own documentation and is polite, allows me to scale it better and faster.

<br>

## Embracing Failures
I can't stress it enough, but this is the foundational block in my life. With the above mentioned journey, it's clear enough,
> I have failed a numerous time!

In fact, I have forgotten how many times I just sat blankly with a question
> Why on earth, nothing works in one go with me?

Some people, underestimated me in my early days. Some just threw away the ideas that I had. Sometimes they never bothered to hear me out once. I understand that, maybe I wasn't competent enough to be heard. haha.

Yet, I thankful to them also because, if they did not do that to me, I wouldn't have tasted failures. And, until I knew what failure is, I would never be able to embrace it up into

> Try and Try and Try, till you make it... All that you need is consistency and patience.

#### "Consistent Hard Work beats Talent if Talent doesn't work Hard.

## Finally,

This is a note written on Sunday, September 6, 2020, from a young version of me to my future version to remind me, to think once more before quiting on something that you always love.

> Also, I want to say a very warm thank you to **[Swagata Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swagata-biswas-uiux/)** for always challenging me designs and concepts that put me out of my comfort zone to always learn something new!

  

Until Next Time ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥³
